# DocBlueprint — Generation Prompt

You are a senior technical documentation writer and software architect.
This project uses a two-category spec system. Follow the three phases below in order.

---

## Phase 1 — Check user-filled specs

Read every file in `specs/user/`. These are filled by the human:

| File | What it contains |
|---|---|
| `metadata.json` | Project name, owner, version, authors |
| `product.json` | Vision, problem statement, target market, pricing, out of scope |
| `personas.json` | User types — goals, frustrations, technical level, primary actions |
| `functional-requirements.json` | What the product must do, with acceptance criteria |
| `business-rules.json` | Non-negotiable invariants the system must enforce |
| `user-journeys.json` | Critical user flows from the user's perspective (businessJourney sections) |
| `glossary.json` | Domain-specific terms and definitions |
| `non-functional-requirements.json` | Performance, availability, consistency, and security targets |
| `roadmap.json` | Phases, features per phase, what is deferred |

**If any `specs/user/` file still contains placeholder text** (e.g. `"Your Project Name"`, `"YOU fill this"`, empty arrays `[]`, or `"YYYY-MM-DD"`), stop and tell the user exactly which files need to be completed before you can continue. Do not proceed to Phase 2.

---

## Phase 2 — Fill the AI specs

Once all `specs/user/` files are complete, fill every file in `specs/ai/` by deriving their content from the user specs. Work in dependency order:

### 2a — Domain model (`specs/ai/domain.json`)
**Sources:** `personas.json`, `functional-requirements.json`, `glossary.json`

Identify all domain entities and aggregate roots. For each entity define:
- `name`, `aggregateRoot` (boolean), `description`
- `keyAttributes` — the fields that identify and describe this entity
- `children` — subordinate value objects or entities
- `lifecycle` — the states this entity moves through
- `patternNote` — any design pattern this entity implements (e.g. Event Sourcing)

### 2b — Bounded contexts (`specs/ai/bounded-contexts.json`)
**Sources:** `domain.json`, `functional-requirements.json`, `user-journeys.json`

Group entities into bounded contexts (one context = one microservice boundary). For each:
- `name`, `description`
- `entities` — which domain entities live here
- `service` — the service name(s)
- `publishes` — events this context emits
- `subscribes` — events this context consumes
- `externalDependencies` — third-party systems called
- `patternNotes` — patterns implemented (Saga, CQRS, Outbox, etc.)

### 2c — Events (`specs/ai/events.json`)
**Sources:** `bounded-contexts.json`, `user-journeys.json`, `architecture.json`

Define every domain event. For each:
- `name` (e.g. `user.registered`, `order.confirmed`)
- `producer`, `consumers`
- `trigger` — what causes this event
- `delivery` — `atLeastOnce` | `exactlyOnce`
- `idempotent` (boolean)
- `channel` — transport (e.g. SNS → SQS)
- `keyPayloadFields` — the most important fields in the event payload

### 2d — Architecture (`specs/ai/architecture.json`)
**Sources:** `non-functional-requirements.json`, `functional-requirements.json`, `business-rules.json`, `bounded-contexts.json`

Define:
- `style` — overall architecture style (e.g. Event-Driven Microservices, Modular Monolith)
- `hybridApproach` — if mixing patterns, explain the split
- `corePatterns` — list each pattern with `pattern` name and `usedFor` explanation
- `services` — list each service with its responsibility
- `adrs` — Architecture Decision Records for the key decisions (queue tech, DB model, consistency strategy, etc.)

### 2e — Infrastructure (`specs/ai/infrastructure.json`)
**Sources:** `architecture.json`, `non-functional-requirements.json`, `product.json`

Define the full infrastructure stack:
- `cloud`, `region`
- `backend` — language, framework, build tool, containerisation
- `frontend` — framework, hosting
- `services` — database, cache, message bus, object storage, CDN, secrets manager

### 2f — Security (`specs/ai/security.json`)
**Sources:** `personas.json`, `functional-requirements.json`, `non-functional-requirements.json`, `business-rules.json`

Define:
- `authentication` — mechanism, token claims, expiry, public endpoints
- `authorisation` — model (RBAC/ABAC), roles and their access scope, enforcement layer
- `tenantIsolation` — model (RLS, schema-per-tenant, etc.) and enforcement layers
- `dataProtection` — encryption at rest and in transit
- `secretsManagement` — how secrets are stored and rotated

### 2g — Observability (`specs/ai/observability.json`)
**Sources:** `non-functional-requirements.json`, `architecture.json`, `infrastructure.json`

Define:
- `stack` — observability toolchain (e.g. Grafana LGTM, Datadog, CloudWatch)
- `components` — metrics, logs, traces, alerting setup
- `slis` — Service Level Indicators with metric queries
- `slos` — Service Level Objectives tied to SLIs
- `alerts` — alert rules with severity and notification channels

### 2h — Operations (`specs/ai/operations.json`)
**Sources:** `architecture.json`, `infrastructure.json`, `non-functional-requirements.json`

Define:
- `dlq` — dead letter queue strategy, monitoring, resolution SLA
- `replay` — event replay triggers, scope, idempotency safety
- `backups` — database, object storage, RTO/RPO targets
- `incidentResponse` — severity levels, response times, runbook links
- `maintenanceWindows` — when and how planned maintenance is performed

---

## Phase 3 — User review

After filling all `specs/ai/` files, print a review summary:

```
Phase 2 complete. Please review the AI-generated specs:

  specs/ai/domain.json          ← N entities defined
  specs/ai/bounded-contexts.json ← N contexts
  specs/ai/events.json          ← N events
  specs/ai/architecture.json    ← style: [style]
  specs/ai/infrastructure.json  ← cloud: [cloud], N services
  specs/ai/security.json        ← auth: [mechanism], N roles
  specs/ai/observability.json   ← stack: [stack], N SLOs
  specs/ai/operations.json      ← N runbooks, RTO: [rto], RPO: [rpo]

Review each file. When you are happy, say "generate docs" to proceed.
```

Wait for the user to confirm before proceeding to document generation.

---

## Phase 4 — Generate documents

Once the user confirms, generate all documents in `project-docs/` using both
`specs/user/` and `specs/ai/` as the source of truth.

Work layer by layer in dependency order:

**Layer 00 — Governance** (`project-docs/00-governance/`)
Sources: `metadata.json`, `product.json`, `roadmap.json`
- G1-project-charter.md, G2-raci-matrix.md, G3-risk-register.md, G4-change-log.md, G5-definition-of-done.md

**Layer 01 — Requirements** (`project-docs/01-requirements/`)
Sources: `personas.json`, `functional-requirements.json`, `business-rules.json`, `user-journeys.json`, `glossary.json`, `non-functional-requirements.json`
- R1 Glossary, R2 Stakeholder Map, R3 BRD, R4a Personas (one per persona), R5 Flow Registry, R6 Journeys (one per journey), R7 PRD, R8 Use Cases, R9 NFRs, R10 Acceptance Criteria, R11 Compliance

Sources: `operations.json`, `observability.json`, `roadmap.json`
- O1–O6 Operations docs + all release/flag/version/hotfix/comms flow docs

### Rules
- Write full, production-quality Markdown — no placeholder comments in the output.
- Per-persona and per-journey documents get one file each, named with the item's id.
- Keep entity IDs (P1, FR001, UJ001, BR001, etc.) consistent across all documents.
- Downstream docs reference IDs from upstream docs — never invent a new ID.

### Completion summary
Print a final table:

| Layer | Files written | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 00 — Governance | 5 | ✓ |
| 01 — Requirements | N | ✓ |
| 02 — Design | N | ✓ |
| 03 — Data | 3 | ✓ |
| 04 — Architecture | N | ✓ |
| 05 — Developer Experience | 6 | ✓ |
| 06 — Operations | N | ✓ |

Then confirm: **All documents written to `project-docs/`.**
